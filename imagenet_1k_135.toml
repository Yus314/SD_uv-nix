description = "The circular object depicted in the image is a slide rule, an analogue computer that allows for mathematical calculations using logarithmic scales.\n\nThe slide rule has three concentric circles with numbers on their circumference. The innermost circle features 12 numbers from 1 to 12 (excluding 11) and is used as the base number for calculations. The middle circle contains numbers from 1 to 10, excluding 5, and is used in conjunction with the outer circle to perform calculations.\n\nThe slide rule's functionality is based on logarithmic scales, allowing users to multiply numbers by sliding a cursor along the inner scale while keeping it aligned with another number on the outer scale. This enables multiplication of two numbers without using an arithmetic process. The slide rule also allows for division and square root operations.\n\nSlide rules were widely used in scientific fields until they were replaced by electronic calculators in the mid-20th century."
